    <span>VD2: Dimensionality Reduction</span>
  </h1>
  <div style="width: 1200px; ">In this visualization exercise, three different dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, MDS and t-SNE) are applied on the 10,000 test set of Fashion MNIST dataset by projecting the high-dimensional data points onto a 2D plane. Each color represents a different class, and when users hover one dot in one visualization, the equivalent dots in the other visualizations will be highlighted with a change in radius and stroke width. The label of the specific data entry will be also indicated when a dot is being highlighted.

  <b>Findings:</b> 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Difficulties:</b> Compare to the first D3 exercise, this visualization was a lot easier to achieve due to overcoming the initial steep learning curve. The only main difficulty was to figure out how to display the text of the corresponding label when a dot is highlighted, as I was not aware that elements without positions (x, y) specified are displayed behind the SVG by default.
